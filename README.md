### Predicting Mutual Fund Prices: A Linear Regression Analysis

This project explores the effectiveness of linear regression models in predicting mutual fund prices, with a focus on 800 actively managed funds in the United States market. The study questions the reliability of these funds as investments, revealing low average returns. The analysis employs standard linear regression, polynomial regression, and lagged linear regression models, finding that lagged linear regression outperforms others. However, linear models struggle to capture the complex fluctuations in fund prices over time. The project aims to determine if repetitive patterns within fund price fluctuations can be used for predictions, irrespective of current market conditions.
