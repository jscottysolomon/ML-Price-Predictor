### Keywords: 

Mutual Funds, Investments, Retirement Planning

### Description: 

I want to analyze the historic performance of mutual funds. Data would likely take the form of the highs and lows of mutual funds within the last 20 years, as well as things like the fees associated with them.    

Potential Questions:

+ How does the performance of S&P 500 index funds compare the the performance of activley managed mutual funds? 
+ What is the best way to calculate projected growth of a mutual fund?
+ Can investing "sustainably" produce similar returns to their nonsustainable counterparts?
+ How does inflation factor into the growth of mutual funds?


### Intellectual Merit:

While these types of financial studies are not neccessarily new, they are regularly performed in order to create valuable insight. This study could provide practical information that can be used by investors or individuals to make informed financial decisions.

### Data Sourcing:

I'm looking for somewhat recent as well as historic data of the performance of mutual funds. Data like this can be found on websites like Yahoo Finance, or other finance-oriented websties.

### Background Knowledge:

Background information would be what mutual funds are and why people invest in them, which can be found [here](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/investment-products/mutual-funds-and-exchange-traded-1). It would also be beneficial to understand [load fees](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/getting-started/understanding-fees) and basic [performance metrics](https://www.bing.com/search?q=mutual+fund+performance+metrics&cvid=4da23090a8db4fe98085d028cc2bab8d&aqs=edge.0.0j69i57j69i64.6020j0j9&FORM=ANAB01&PC=U531).

### Related Works: 

*[Luck versus Skill in the Cross-Section of Mutual Fund Returns](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40864991)* examines the performance of activley managed mutual funds and if they produce returns that justify their higher fees.

*[Performance and Persistence in Institutional Investment Management](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01550.x)* examines whether historic performance of activley managed mutual funds is indicative of future success.
