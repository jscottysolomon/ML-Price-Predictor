### Keywords:


Mutual Funds, Investments, Retirement Planning


### Description:


I am analyzing the historical performance of an actively-managed mutual fund in order to predict its future value. Due to the nature of retirement investing, this project is focused on long-term gains rather, and consequently, the projected value of a fund in a long-term basis.


### Research Questions


**RO1**: To describe the long term trends associated with actively-managed mutual funds


**RO2**: To predict the value of a fund at the end of a time period equal to its historical data length


**RO3**: To defend the model for performing the prediction in RO2


**RO4**: To defend the model for performing the prediction in RO2




### Intellectual Merit:


While these types of financial studies are not necessarily new, they are regularly performed in order to create valuable insight. This study could provide practical information that can be used by investors or individuals to make informed financial decisions.


### Data Sourcing:


Data is sourced from web scrapping Yahoo Finance.


### Background Knowledge:


Background information would be what mutual funds are and why people invest in them, which can be found [here](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/investment-products/mutual-funds-and-exchange-traded-1).


It would also be beneficial to understand [load fees](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/getting-started/understanding-fees) and basic [performance metrics](https://www.bing.com/search?q=mutual+fund+performance+metrics&cvid=4da23090a8db4fe98085d028cc2bab8d&aqs=edge.0.0j69i57j69i64.6020j0j9&FORM=ANAB01&PC=U531).
